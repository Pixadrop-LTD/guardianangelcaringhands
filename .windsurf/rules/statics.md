# Implementation Guidelines

The app is built using **Tailwind CSS** and **Alpine.js**, strictly following best practices from their official documentation. All design, UX, and interaction rules—including cursor behavior—are defined in the `.planning` folder.

---

## Before Implementing or Updating the App

Always review the following files for full design and functional context:

- `.planning/summary.md`
- `.planning/structure.md`
- `.planning/features.md`
- `.planning/wireframes.md`
- `.planning/concept.md`
- `.planning/gudlines.md`

> For detailed guidlines, refer to the `.planning/guidlines.md` file.

Before executing any task, take the time to thoroughly review all files in the .planning folder and the .planning/wireframes directory to fully understand the context and expectations.

## Design System & UI Standards

- All **color palettes**, **gradients**, **typography**, and **component designs** are defined in `.planning/wireframes.md`.
- Always design and implement a **modern, advanced, and highly interactive user interface** that leverages the latest advancements in UI/UX.

### Key UI Features Should Include:

- Gradient **floating navigation bars**
- UI Must Be A Beautiful Design
- Gradient **CTA buttons**
- Smooth **transition animations**
- Engaging **scroll-triggered effects**
- A clean and contemporary visual style using **gradient-based color palettes**

> When using gradients, **always transition from the primary color to the secondary color** defined in the design system.

## Development Standards

- Use **Context7** for all TailwindCss Version 4 and AlpineJS version 3 documents to ensure design system consistency.
- Apply best practices from official **Tailwind CSS** and **Alpine.js** documentation to maintain:
  - Code quality
  - Accessibility
  - Responsive Design 
  - Beautiful design
  - Use the latest version of tailwindcss and alpinejs

## Key Task

Your task is to develop a modern, fully functional HTML-based website using Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. The website should include all pages, sections, features and UI elements as  specified in the .planning folder and be built according to the wireframes provided in the .planning/wireframes directory

## IMPORTANT NOTE

- The entire website must be fully designed and stored in the .static folder, including all HTML files, JavaScript files, and assets..

---

## Consistency

All customizations should align with both:

- The **Context7** design system
- **TailwindCss and AlpineJS** recommended best practices
-**Always use Tailwindcss for styling and animations.
-**Do not use Alpinejs or Javscritp for animations.
